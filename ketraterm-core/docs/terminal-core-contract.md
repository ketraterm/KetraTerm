# Terminal Core Contract

This document defines the public behavioral contract of `:ketraterm-core`.

It is the handoff boundary for future `:ketraterm-parser` and `:ketraterm-input`
modules. If code outside the core depends on behavior not described here, that
behavior is not yet guaranteed.

## Scope

The core owns:

- grid mutation and overwrite physics
- cursor state and movement
- deferred wrap / `pendingWrap`
- scroll regions (`DECSTBM`, `DECLRMM`)
- erase operations (`ED`, `EL`, `ECH`, selective erase)
- line and character editing (`ICH`, `DCH`, `IL`, `DL`)
- tab stops (`HT`, `CHT`, `CBT`, `HTS`, `TBC`)
- protected cells (`DECSCA`, `DECSED`, `DECSEL`)
- primary / alternate buffer lifecycle
- resize and reflow
- `DECCOLM`
- durable terminal mode state
- attribute packing and pen state, including indexed/RGB colors, underline
  color/style, common text attributes, hyperlink ids, and inverse
- cluster storage and history storage

The core does not own:

- escape-sequence parsing
- grapheme segmentation
- charset designation / shift-state translation (`G0..G3`, `SO`, `SI`)
- mouse event routing
- host-bound input encoding
- rendering
- font measurement

## Public API surfaces

`TerminalBuffer` composes these narrower contracts:

- `TerminalWriter`
- `TerminalCursor`
- `TerminalModeController`
- `TerminalModeReader`
- `TerminalReader`
- `TerminalInspector`

External parser and input code should depend on the narrowest interface they
need instead of the full facade.

## Writer contract

### Printable ingress

- `writeCodepoint(codepoint)` writes one Unicode scalar value.
- `writeText(text)` writes the string as a sequence of scalar codepoints.
- `writeCluster(codepoints, length)` writes one pre-segmented visual cluster.
  The core computes its grid width from the active width policy.
- `appendToPreviousCluster(codepoint)` appends a parser-identified grapheme
  continuation to the most recently written printable cell without moving the
  cursor. This supports live rendering at host read boundaries while preserving
  chunk-boundary combining marks and ZWJ continuations.

Guaranteed behavior:

- wide-cell and cluster overwrite is shape-safe
- no orphaned wide spacers are left behind
- insert mode and replace mode use the same overwrite invariants
- deferred wrap follows terminal semantics
- clusters are stored in the active buffer arena and survive reflow by
  deep-copy into the new arena
- parser-identified grapheme continuations preserve the cursor position and
  wide spacer invariants

Not guaranteed:

- grapheme segmentation
- deciding whether a codepoint is a combining mark, variation selector, or ZWJ
  continuation

Those belong to `:ketraterm-parser`.

### Erase and edit commands

The writer surface owns:

- `newLine`, `reverseLineFeed`, `carriageReturn`
- `setScrollRegion`, `resetScrollRegion`
- `setLeftRightMargins`
- `scrollUp`, `scrollDown`
- `insertLines`, `deleteLines`
- `insertBlankCharacters`, `deleteCharacters`
- `eraseCharacters`
- all line/screen erase variants
- all selective erase variants
- `clearScreen`, `clearAll`
- pen mutation and selective-erase protection state

Guaranteed behavior:

- structural edits cancel `pendingWrap`
- `ECH` erases without shifting
- `ICH` / `DCH` are constrained by active horizontal margins
- `IL` / `DL` are constrained by the active vertical region and are no-op when
  the cursor is outside it
- normal erase ignores cell protection
- selective erase respects cell protection
- hard clears ignore cell protection

## Cursor contract

The cursor surface owns:

- absolute and relative cursor motion
- `DECSC` / `DECRC`
- tab stop commands

### `DECSC` / `DECRC`

The core-owned save slot includes:

- cursor column
- cursor row
- pen attributes
- `pendingWrap`
- origin mode (`DECOM`)

The core does not save or restore:

- charset designation
- locking shifts
- parser-owned shift state

Those remain parser state and must be handled outside `:ketraterm-core`.

If no save slot exists, `restoreCursor()` falls back to the core's documented
absolute home plus pen reset behavior.

### Tabs

Guaranteed behavior:

- `HT`, `CHT`, and `CBT` never wrap
- forward tab movement clamps at the active right boundary
- backward tab movement clamps at the active left boundary
- `HTS`, `TBC 0`, and `TBC 3` cancel `pendingWrap`
- resize preserves surviving tab stops, drops truncated ones, and seeds newly
  exposed columns with default 8-column stops
- hard reset and `DECCOLM` reset tab stops destructively to the default rhythm

## Mode-state contract

`TerminalModeController` is the public write surface for durable mode state.

`TerminalModeReader.getModeSnapshot()` is the public read surface.

Durable mode state currently exposed by core:

- insert mode
- auto-wrap
- application cursor keys
- application keypad
- origin mode
- newline mode
- left/right margin mode
- reverse video
- cursor visible
- cursor blinking
- bracketed paste enabled
- focus reporting enabled
- East Asian ambiguous-width policy
- mouse tracking mode
- mouse encoding mode
- modify-other-keys mode

Guaranteed behavior:

- mode setters that home or otherwise alter cursor physics cancel `pendingWrap`;
  input, reporting, presentation, palette, and other non-cursor modes preserve it
- public mode reads are immutable snapshots
- input/UI code cannot mutate internal mode storage directly

## Reader contract

`TerminalReader` and `TerminalLineApi` provide safe, allocation-light access to
stored state.

Guaranteed behavior:

- out-of-bounds line reads return a void line
- out-of-bounds codepoint reads return `0`
- packed cell attributes are exposed as primary and extended `Long` words
  decoded together by `AttributeCodec`
- blank cells read as `0`
- wide spacers read as `-1`
- cluster cells return the leading/base codepoint through `getCodepointAt`
- full cluster contents are available through `readCluster`

Not guaranteed:

- raw storage handles
- direct access to internal arrays

## Buffer lifecycle contract

### Primary and alternate screens

- primary and alternate buffers have separate arenas
- alternate buffer has no scrollback history
- `47` entry switches to the alternate buffer without clearing or cursor save/restore
- `1047` entry clears the alternate buffer, homes its cursor, and resets its margins
- `1048` saves/restores cursor state without switching buffers
- `1049` combines cursor save/restore with a clearing alternate-buffer switch
- leaving alternate screen returns to primary as it was left unless the selected
  variant explicitly restores the saved cursor
- resize reflows primary and wipes alt

### Resize

`resize(newWidth, newHeight)` guarantees:

- primary logical-line reconstruction and rewrap
- cursor relocation into the reflowed primary content
- deep-copy of surviving clusters into a fresh primary store
- alternate-screen wipe and recreation at the new dimensions
- scroll margins reset/clamped to the new viewport
- left/right margins reset to full width
- tab stops resized non-destructively
- saved-cursor state clamped to valid bounds

### Soft reset

`softReset()` implements DECSTR (`CSI ! p`).

Guaranteed behavior:

- visible content and scrollback are preserved
- dimensions, tab stops, and active screen selection are preserved
- insert, origin, application cursor/keypad, cursor presentation, left/right
  margin mode, and modify-other-keys state reset to defaults
- bracketed paste, focus reporting, and mouse reporting modes are preserved
- top/bottom and left/right margins reset to the full viewport on both buffers
- current cursor position is preserved, but pending wrap is cleared
- saved-cursor slots restore to home with default pen state
- active pen attributes, hyperlink id, and selective-erase write protection
  reset to defaults

### `DECCOLM`

`executeDeccolm(newWidth)` accepts only `80` or `132`.

Guaranteed sequence:

1. resize both buffers to the new width
2. clear the active display and its history
3. home the active cursor to absolute `(0, 0)`
4. reset active scroll margins
5. reset active left/right margins
6. reset tab stops to the default 8-column rhythm
7. cancel `pendingWrap`
8. preserve both saved-cursor slots

When alt is active, the core follows the xterm-style policy:

- alternate screen is wiped at the new width
- primary screen is reflowed in the background

## Protection contract

Protection is erase-only.

Guaranteed behavior:

- `DECSCA` stamps protection onto future written cells
- normal writes overwrite protected cells
- normal erase ignores protection
- selective erase skips protected cells
- wide spacers inherit the protection status of their leader
- protection survives reflow
- hard clear ignores protection

## Invariants

The core maintains these invariants on public mutation paths:

- no orphaned wide spacers
- horizontal-margin line mutations annihilate destination occupants crossing
  either slice boundary and never copy an incomplete wide source span
- no stale live cluster handles after erase/shift/resize paths
- per-buffer cluster-store ownership is never shared
- tab-stop array width always matches terminal width
- public non-printing operations clear `pendingWrap`

## Intentional deviations

These are intentional boundary choices, not accidental gaps:

- no grapheme segmentation in core
- no charset save/restore in `DECSC` / `DECRC`
- no rendering behavior beyond storing renderer-facing flags
- no host-bound mouse / keyboard encoding

## Pre-1.0 change surface

Likely to evolve before 1.0:

- parser/input handoff docs
- mode snapshot growth if more host-controlled flags are surfaced
- parser-facing docs around charset ownership and Unicode ingestion

The runtime semantics described in this document are the current intended
contract for integrating `:ketraterm-parser` and `:ketraterm-input`.
