# Terminal Feature Map

This document catalogs every supported terminal feature, protocol, and capability in KetraTerm.

For a detailed backlog of gaps and intentional non-goals, see the [Terminal Feature Gap Map](terminal-feature-gap-map.md).

---

## 1. Terminal Protocols & Control Sequences

- **Margin Physics**:
  - Vertical scroll margins (`DECSTBM` / `CSI Pt ; Pb r`).
  - Left/right scroll margins (`DECSLRM` / `CSI Pl ; Pr s`).
- **Screen & Line Erasures**:
  - Selective line erasing (`DECSEL` / `CSI Ps ? K`).
  - Selective display erasing (`DECSED` / `CSI Ps ? J`).
  - Character erasing (`ECH` / `CSI Ps X`).
- **Selective Erase Protection**: Protected cell marking (`DECSCA` / `CSI Ps " q`) stamps protection onto characters to shield them from normal line and display erasures.
- **Buffer Switching**: Instantly switches between Primary and Alternate screen buffers (modes `47`, `1047`, `1048`, `1049`). Alternate screen isolates cursor save slots, margins, and automatically homes and clears the screen on entry (for `1047`/`1049`).
- **Column Toggles**: Dynamic 80/132 column switching (`DECCOLM` / `CSI Ps space $ |`) with automatic viewport resizes, screen clearing, and margin/tab-stop resets.
- **Grid Editing**: Line Insert (`IL` / `CSI Ps L`), Line Delete (`DL` / `CSI Ps M`), Character Insert (`ICH` / `CSI Ps @`), and Character Delete (`DCH` / `CSI Ps P`) constrained within horizontal and vertical margins.
- **Tab Stop Control**:
  - Tab Set (`HTS` / `ESC H`).
  - Tab Clear (`TBC` mode 0 clears active stop; mode 3 clears all stops).
  - Horizontal Tab (`HT` / `\t`).
  - Cursor Horizontal Tab (`CHT` / `CSI Ps I`).
  - Cursor Backward Tab (`CBT` / `CSI Ps Z`).
- **Cursor Settings**:
  - Blinking and visibility controls (`?25`).
  - Cursor shape styling (`DECSCUSR` / `CSI Ps SP q`) supporting Blinking Block (`1`), Steady Block (`2`), Blinking Underline (`3`), Steady Underline (`4`), Blinking Bar (`5`), and Steady Bar (`6`).
- **Resets**: Hard Reset (`RIS` / `ESC c`) and Soft Reset (`DECSTR` / `CSI ! p`).
- **Synchronized Output Mode**: Supports rendering synchronization (private mode `2026`). When enabled, terminal output updates are buffered in `TerminalSession` and flushed only when disabled or when the synchronization timeout (default 250ms) expires, preventing visual flickering during heavy stdout.
- **DEC Alignment Test**: Renders DEC alignment test character grid (`DECALN` / `ESC # 8`).
- **Window Manipulation**: Support for standard xterm window manipulation sequences (`CSI 1 t` de-minimize, `CSI 2 t` minimize, `CSI 3 ; x ; y t` move, `CSI 5 t` raise, `CSI 6 t` lower, `CSI 8 ; rows ; cols t` resize, `CSI 9 ; mode t` maximize/restore) gated by a secure user setting (`shell_request_window_manipulation`).
- **ISO 2022 Charsets**: G0-G3 designation sets (ASCII and DEC Special Graphics) with locking shifts (`SO`/`SI`) and single shifts (`SS2`/`SS3`).

---

## 2. Text Styling & Color (SGR)

- **Text Attributes**: Bold (`1`), Faint/Dim (`2`), Italic (`3`), Underline (`4`), Blink (`5`), Inverse (`7`), Conceal (`8`), Strikethrough (`9`), and Overline (`53`) graphic modifers.
- **Underline Styles**: Single (`4:1`), Double (`4:2`), Curly (`4:3`), Dotted (`4:4`), and Dashed (`4:5`) underline styles.
- **Palette & TrueColor**:
  - 8 standard and 8 bright SGR colors.
  - 256-indexed color maps (`SGR 38:5:Ps` / `48:5:Ps`).
  - 24-bit TrueColor RGB mapping (`SGR 38:2:r:g:b` / `48:2:r:g:b`), supporting both colon-separated and semicolon-separated parameter sequences.
  - Custom SGR underline colors (`SGR 58/59`).

---

## 3. Operating System Commands (OSC) & Device Control (DCS)

- **Title Management**: Window, icon, or combined title updates with push/pop stack operations (`CSI 22 t` / `CSI 23 t`). Updates are host-policy gated through an explicit local/remote origin contract; standalone-compatible defaults accept updates and clamp oversized titles, while IDE, workspace, or SSH profiles can deny remote renames or reject overlong values.
- **OSC 8 Hyperlinks**: Inline hyperlink parsing (`OSC 8 ; id ; url ESC \`) with interactive Ctrl-click navigation and a bounded, double-indexed LRU eviction registry in the host.
- **OSC 7 Current Working Directory**: Absolute `file://` directory URIs are parsed from bounded OSC payloads, validated and length-limited by host policy, retained as thread-safe session and per-tab workspace metadata, forwarded through PTY/workspace callbacks, and snapshotted onto bounded OSC 133 command records. Workspace launch profiles emit percent-encoded OSC 7 reports before each prompt for supported interactive PowerShell/PowerShell Core, Bash/Git Bash, zsh, and fish shells. The standalone app uses a sanitized directory-name tab-title fallback and offers **Open Terminal Here** for existing local directories; remote-authority reports remain observable metadata and are not treated as local paths. Invalid, duplicate, or oversized reports do not create redundant workspace changes.
- **OSC 133 Shell Integration Markers**: FinalTerm/iTerm-compatible shell lifecycle marker events (`OSC 133 ; A/B/C/D ST`) are parsed and forwarded through host, PTY, and workspace event boundaries. Core exposes stable primitive render-line identities that move with content through scroll, clear-history, and resize reflow; session-owned shell integration state stores a bounded primitive command timeline keyed by those identities and projects prompt starts, failed-command output, command boundaries, stable command record ids, and primitive lifecycle states into caller-owned viewport arrays. Prompt spans whose `A` marker precedes leading blank layout rows, including the default Git Bash prompt, anchor their gutter decoration to the first proven rendered prompt row at `B`; unavailable or empty spans preserve the protocol anchor instead of guessing. Records expose event-driven command, working-directory, exit-status, and start/finish timestamp snapshots without adding objects to viewport projection. Swing paints compact prompt dots and failed-output rails without changing row pitch, supports prompt-marker click selection, previous/next command navigation, command hit-testing, and exact retained-output copy/export with soft-wrap reconstruction. Session metadata reconstructs bounded single-line and multiline command text between prompt-end and command-start markers, including retained scrollback rows and grapheme clusters; ambiguous, unavailable, or oversized text remains unknown instead of being guessed. The standalone host offers opt-in, versioned, atomic, bounded command-metadata persistence on a background worker (fully detailed in [Persistent Terminal Storage Layout](persistent-terminal-storage.md)), equipped with built-in security filters that prevent raw commands containing secrets, tokens, or credentials, or commands with leading whitespace, from being written to disk; raw terminal output is never persisted automatically. Workspace launch profiles inject idempotent startup hooks for supported interactive PowerShell/PowerShell Core, Bash/Git Bash, zsh, fish, and explicitly selected Bash/zsh/fish shells under WSL/Ubuntu launchers. Unknown WSL default shells remain untouched to preserve launch semantics.
- **OSC Palette Queries**: Dynamic color palette queries and updates (`OSC 4 / 10 / 11 / 12`), allowing applications to query standard palette colors or default foreground/background/cursor colors.
- **Desktop Notifications**:
  - **iTerm2 Style (`OSC 9`)**: Triggers a notification body payload (`OSC 9 ; message ST` or `BEL`).
  - **urxvt Style (`OSC 777`)**: Triggers a notification with separate title and body (`OSC 777 ; notify ; title ; body ST` or `BEL`).
  - **Extended Severity Protocol**: Optional fourth parameter (`OSC 777 ; notify ; title ; body ; level ST`) accepting `info` (standard info icon), `warning` (warning icon), `error` (error icon), or `none` (renders the custom KetraTerm `>` symbol instead of OS defaults).
  - **Operational Policies**: Explicitly filters ConEmu conflicting subcommands (skips digits `0-4`, `9` after `OSC 9;`). Protects the system tray by reusing a single `TrayIcon` instance on the EDT with a self-cleaning **10-second** inactivity cleanup timer. Clamps parameters to a maximum title length of 256 characters and body of 1024 characters.
- **Capability Queries (DCS)**:
  - **DECRQSS**: Queries active SGR attributes (`m`), top/bottom scroll regions (`r`), left/right margins (`s`), and cursor shape configurations (`q`).
  - **XTGETTCAP / XTSETTCAP**: Queries color capabilities (`Co`/`colors` returning `256`), terminal name (`TN`/`name` returning `xterm-256color`), and TrueColor support (`RGB`/`Tc` returning boolean success). Responses are strictly checked against a security allowlist and sourced from the shared terminal capability identity contract.

## 4. Query-Response Channels

- **Host Security Policy**: Host-affecting terminal controls are gated at the `ketraterm-host` adapter boundary before they mutate host metadata, call host event sinks, alter palette state, or enqueue terminal-to-host response bytes. `HostPolicy` provides explicit controls for title/icon updates, OSC 8 hyperlinks, OSC 7 current-working-directory reports, desktop notifications, window manipulation requests, OSC palette controls, terminal response channels, and clipboard request auditing. Implemented controls default to allowed for compatibility, while OSC 52 clipboard writes remain deny-by-default and execute only when a product host explicitly enables the permission surface. Host-owned payloads are bounded per feature, including title clamp/reject policy, hyperlink URIs/IDs and registry size, notification title/body text, OSC 7 directory URI length, and OSC 52 decoded payload size.
- **OSC 52 Clipboard Policy Surface**: OSC 52 clipboard requests are parsed as bounded semantic requests and evaluated by a deny-by-default host policy. The policy models local vs remote session origin, independent local and remote write permissions (`deny`, `prompt`, `allowlist`, or `allow`), disabled read/query behavior by default, an allowlisted-session marker owned by product hosts, and a maximum decoded payload size. Host audit events report operation type, selection, origin, encoded length, decoded byte count, limit, and decision without including clipboard contents. Allowed write requests are decoded to UTF-8 text and forwarded through host, PTY, workspace, standalone Swing, and IntelliJ plugin clipboard callbacks. Prompt-required write requests are decoded only for product-host prompt callbacks, and standalone plus IntelliJ hosts show a confirmation dialog before writing. Denied, malformed, oversized, and read/query requests never carry clipboard contents. OSC 52 read/query responses remain unsupported.
- **Terminal Capability Identity**: A shared `TerminalCapabilityIdentity` contract owns all advertised identity constants used by launch environments and terminal query responses. KetraTerm currently advertises `$TERM=xterm-256color`, `COLORTERM=truecolor`, primary DA `CSI ? 1 ; 2 c`, secondary DA `CSI > 0 ; 0 ; 0 c`, XTGETTCAP `TN`/`name=xterm-256color`, `Co`/`colors=256`, boolean `RGB`/`Tc`, and the implemented Kitty keyboard progressive flag mask. DA3 remains silent to avoid stable unit-id fingerprinting, and `CSI ? u` Kitty keyboard capability query responses remain disabled until a response policy is implemented.
- **Operating Status**: Responds operating status `CSI 0 n` on `DSR 5`.
- **Cursor Position Reports**: Responds active coordinate position on `CPR` / `DSR 6`.
- **Device Attributes**: VT100-compatible primary attribute response (`DA`) and generic secondary attribute response (`DA2`).
- **Window Size/State Reporting**: Responds window minimized/normal state (`CSI 11 t`), screen size in cells (`CSI 19 t`), grid dimensions in characters (`CSI 18 t`), or pixel dimensions (`CSI 14 t`).

## 5. Text & Unicode Engine

- **Unicode 17.0.0 Data Tables**: Uses generated Unicode 17.0.0 grapheme break, emoji property, and terminal width tables for UAX #29-style multi-scalar grapheme segmentation and emoji presentation states.
- **Combining Marks**: Full support for zero-width extenders, including Thai and Lao combining characters.
- **East Asian Width**: Dynamic width calculations supporting wide, narrow, and East Asian Ambiguous width modes.
- **Live Grapheme Rendering**: Progressive rendering of printable prefixes without cursor movement for combining marks or ZWJ extensions.

---

## 6. Input Encoding & Event Reporting

- **Keyboard Mappings**: Support for physical keys, printables, Ctrl/Alt modifier combinations, keypad modes, and PF1-PF4 mappings.
- **xterm Key Enhancements**: modifyOtherKeys modes 1 and 2, and compact CSI-u layout (`formatOtherKeys=1`).
- **Kitty Keyboard Protocol**: High-fidelity key encoding supporting progressive flags:
  - Disambiguate escape codes (`1`).
  - Report all keys as escape codes (`8`).
  - Supports flag application modes: Replace (`1`), Set (`2`), and Clear (`3`), with a bounded mode push/pop stack.
  - Event types (`2`), alternate keys (`4`), and associated text (`16`) remain defined protocol vocabulary but are not advertised or retained until the public input event model can carry that data.
- **Bracketed Paste**: paste payload wrapping (`CSI 200~` / `CSI 201~`) is driven by the input-facing core mode snapshot. Bracketed paste preserves clipboard line endings exactly. Unbracketed local PTY input canonicalizes every clipboard newline form to CR, matching the Enter-key contract used by ConPTY-backed interactive shells and avoiding LF-driven duplicate or reversed PSReadLine continuation lines. `TerminalInputPolicy` separates that transport decision from payload sanitization: raw passthrough by default, optional C0 stripping except TAB/CR/LF, or explicit newline normalization. The standalone/workspace configuration persists the sanitization policy through `paste_sanitization` and applies it to newly opened tabs and splits.
- **Focus Reporting**: Focus in/out sequences (`CSI I` / `CSI O`).
- **Mouse Protocols**: SGR mouse tracking (`?1006`), legacy tracking (`ESC [ M` coordinate-clamped to one-based limit 223), UTF-8 mouse (`?1005`), URXVT mouse (`?1015`), and high-precision SGR-Pixels (`?1016`).

## 7. Embedding & Swing UI

- **PTY Process Integration**: Spawns default platform shells using Pty4J with Windows ConPTY support and prompt resizing.
- **Custom Line Height**: Dynamic line spacing/height scaling (from 0.5x to 3.0x) supported in settings and rendered in the Swing UI.
- **Scrollback & Selection Policies**: Auto-follow (`scrollOnOutput`) configuration, resize viewport offset-retention, and clipboard copy operations spanning the full scrollback history.
- **High-Performance Painting**: Decoupled, multi-threaded rendering using triple-buffering to achieve 60+ FPS paint cycles with zero tearing under heavy stdout throughput.
- **Font Fallbacks & Resolver API**: Scan and fall back to native system fonts for color emojis and complex visual shapes. Embedding environments can supply a `TerminalFontResolver` (such as the IntelliJ plugin's optimized `ComplementaryFontsRegistry` integration) to perform native fallback searches and bypass slow AWT system font iterations.
- **Script-Run Text Shaping**: Complex Swing text rendering splits terminal rows into direction-, style-, attribute-, and Unicode-script-compatible runs before feeding the whole logical run to Java2D `TextLayout`, preserving contextual shaping for Arabic joining, Indic reordering, and connected scripts without moving ASCII rendering off the fast path.
- **Windows Emoji Rasterizer**: Segoe UI Emoji COLR/CPAL color glyph painting.
- **Interactive Selection**: Drag selecting with velocity autoscrolling, Alt-drag block selection, double-click smart selection (words, paths, URLs), triple-click line selection, middle-click paste, and system clipboard interfaces.
- **Scrollback Search**: Regex-free text search scanning viewport and retained scrollback history, ignoring soft-wrapping boundaries.
- **Shell Suggestion Popup Surface**: Reusable Swing terminals expose a configurable, host-fed shell suggestion popup with keyboard and mouse selection, grid-cell anchoring, host acceptance callbacks, and standalone/IntelliJ settings toggles. The standalone host includes a profile-scoped command-history suggestion provider backed by the existing bounded, opt-in command metadata store. Command-line replacement semantics remain product-host responsibilities.
- **Fixed-Grid Smooth Swing Viewport**: One allocation-conscious row-scrolling engine serves notched mouse wheels, precise trackpads, Shift+Page Up/Down keyboard paging, selection-drag autoscroll, programmatic navigation, and standalone/IntelliJ scrollbars. The reusable Swing terminal defaults to zero top padding so smooth row animation can enter and leave through the top edge without clipping, while preserving a compact right edge for natural wrapping, a stable bottom spacer, and the left shell-integration decoration gutter. Alternate-screen rendering suppresses prompt decorations and uses symmetric left/right insets equal to the bottom spacer, then resizes the terminal grid to the newly available columns so full-screen TUIs avoid fake right slack. Optional host padding is treated consistently as an explicit visual inset on all four edges. Precise device deltas accumulate without moving content until they emit whole rows; every destination and resting viewport is therefore row-aligned. Animation retains a fractional visual position only while easing between integer destinations, with line-based render-cache addressing through an integer anchor and one overscan row clipped to the terminal grid. A fractional component height is covered by a separate render-only row, so a 10.9-row viewport requests 11 rows at rest and up to 12 during animation without changing the 10-row terminal grid. The Swing cache reserves both transient rows and reuses its primitive planes while overscan toggles, avoiding animation-loop storage allocation. Scrollbar dragging remains continuous at the thumb while every position maps immediately to an integer terminal top row, so content has no drag lag and release is already aligned. Allocation-free primitive viewport notifications keep the thumb synchronized on every animation frame; full snapshot objects remain event-level only. Sub-row animation frames update translated geometry without rereading the render cache or rebuilding shell/search projections until the integer render mapping changes. Hit testing, repaint bounds, command anchors, and terminal-pixel mouse coordinates consume the same translated geometry. Shell-integration prompt dots remain zero-layout decorations and never change row pitch, visible row count, scroll range, mouse coordinates, or PTY dimensions.
- **Bell Indicators**: Alerts embedding hosts of beep signals (`BEL`) through independently configurable audible bell and visual bell policies. The reusable Swing terminal can show a subtle edge pulse that remains available when audio is disabled.
