# Module ketraterm-completion

## KetraTerm Completion (`:ketraterm-completion`)

The `ketraterm-completion` module defines the dependency-free command-line
completion engine foundation shared by standalone and IDE hosts.

It owns pure request/candidate/spec models, command-line tokenization, bounded
in-process spec evaluation, ranking, and bounded exact-command learning. The
built-in command catalog is shared and immutable rather than reconstructed for
each consumer.

The module does not spawn shells, perform I/O, depend on UI frameworks, or parse
terminal output.

Its best-effort replay policy decides whether bounded plaintext may enter
retained history or observed-token learning; approval is not a guarantee that a
command contains no secret. Ranking evidence uses a case-sensitive opaque command
identity and remains available even when plaintext replay is rejected.
Only successful or accepted outcomes can retain that replay projection. Replay
history and observed-token inference require an exact profile and canonical
working-directory match at request time, including exact null context; opaque
ranking evidence retains its context-fallback semantics.
Optional local-file storage and write scheduling are supplied by the separate
`ketraterm-completion-persistence` module, while asynchronous provider
infrastructure belongs to `ketraterm-completion-host`.

Completion sources such as curated command specs, Fig-style spec importers,
path providers, and IDE context providers should adapt into this module's stable
model rather than leaking their source-specific representation into terminal UI
code. One bounded learning aggregate publishes separate opaque ranking and
positive, policy-approved replay projections; the latter alone feeds history and
observed-token candidates.
